My Idea Drawer

Still in progress.


Setup:

After cloning the repository, run "script/setup" to set up your 
environment ready for development. This will install all the necessary 
gems and plugins.

If you want to run the tests, run "script/setup_test" to setup your 
test environment. And then you can run "rake spec" to run the specs.
